## Overview
What makes one country happier than another? What factors around the world have the highest correlation to a country's happiness? A country's happines is calculated using 6 standard factors along with an additional factor - Dystopia Residual to create one happiness score. From initial analysis the main contributing factor to happiness is the Dystopia Residual. The Dsytopia Residual is a number left over from the normalization of variables that cannot be explained. The main focus of this project is to determine what external factor(s) make up the Dystopia Residual score. Analysis of population density, infant mortality rates, suicide rates, unemployment, and yearly precipitation against the top and bottom scoring countries will help determine whether or not these factors contribute to happiness. 

### Questions to Answer
- Who are the top 5 and bottom 5 happiest countries?
- What are the top 3 factors that contribute to the happiest countries?
- What other factors are related to world happiness score? (Suicide rates, infant mortality, average precipitation, unemployment rates)
- How does the U.S. compare?
- What other areas do the happiest countries excel in as well?
- As a member of the U.S. government, what world happiness factors do I need to improve so I can have a happier country?
