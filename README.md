## Overview
What makes one country happier than another? What factors around the world have the highest correlation to a countries happiness? A countries happines is calculated using 6 standard factors along with an extra factor called Dystopia Residual to create one happiness score. From initial analysis the main contributing factor to happiness is the Dystopia Residual. The Dsytopia Residual is a number left over from the normalization of variables that cannot be explained. The main focus of this project is to determine what external factor(s) make up the Dystopia Residual score. Analysis of population density, infant mortality rates, suicide rates, unemployment, and yearly precipitation against the top and bottom scoring countries will help determine if these factors contribute to happiness or not.
